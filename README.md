*******************************************************************************************

This was my work for Advanced Machine Learning course at Paris Saclay Machine Learning Master.
The notebook contains an implicit feed-back matrix factorization model that achieve 85% of accuracy on the kaggle challenge.
The algorithm was proposed in 2008 and is the subject of this article : http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractSimilar.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4781121&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D4781121

You can find more informations about the challenge or may be test it here : https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/aalto-music-listening-prediction
